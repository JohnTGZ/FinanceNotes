    "In practice, hedging is not as straightforward:\n",
    "1. Asset whose price is to be hedged may not be exactly the same as the asset underlying the futures contract\n",
    "2. There may be uncertainty as to the exact date when the asset will be bought or sold.\n",
    "3. The hedge may require the futures contract to be closed out before its delivery month\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Basis\n",
    "\n",
    "Basis = Spot price of asset to be hedged - Futures price of contract used\n",

    "1 key factor affecting basis risk is the choice of futures contract to be used for hedging, there are 2 components:\n",
    "1. Choice of the asset underlying the futures contract\n",
    "2. Choice of the delivery month\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, basis risk increases as the time difference between the hedge expriation and the delivery month increases. A good rule of thumb is therefore to choose a delivery month that is as close as possible to, but later than, the expiration of the hedge\n",
